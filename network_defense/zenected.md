# Zenected Threat Defense VPN

### Description
__Zenected__ is a cloud based security threat protection service. It’s delivered through a set of pre-configured services. Once a user connects to the __Zenected__, that user’s network traffic is filtered to keep the bad things out (e.g. phishing sites, malware). The only thing this a user has to configure on the endpoint device (be it a mobile device, a desktop or laptop or IoT device) is a VPN connection.

All services are updated every hour with a new set of threat indicators prepared by Perun Works.

__Zenected__ is easy to manage. It uses a web front-end for administrators to manage your instance. An administrator user can:
- manage __Zenected__ users including adding more admin users
- blacklist URLs or domain names that you don't want your users to access
- whitelist URLs or domain names, that were identified as malicious but you still want your users to be able to get to them
- review exception requests from users

If you are a __Zenected__ end-user what you will like about it, is:
- no need to install additional software on your mobile phone, tablet or laptop – __Zenected__ uses standard OS features build-in into all modern systems
- if you encounter a certain resource blocked by the system, you can request an exception. Each exception is then reviewed by an administrator.
