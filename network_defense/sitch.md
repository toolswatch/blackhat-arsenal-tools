# SITCH

### Description

SITCH is a distributed cellular anomaly detection and countersurveillance platform.  

SITCH is comprised of a number of sensors and a central service.  Sensors are made from easily sourced hardware, and the cost of required components is around $150 each.  All information produced by the sensors is aggregated in the service, which handles alerting and data retention.
