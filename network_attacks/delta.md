# DELTA

### Description
DELTA is a first SDN security evaluation framework, which has two primary functions; (1) It can automatically instantiate attack cases against SDN elements across diverse environments, and (2) it can assist in uncovering unknown security problems within an SDN deployment by using a blackbox fuzzing technique. For replaying attack cases, our framework has a number of test cases against popular SDN controllers and all SDN-enabled switch devices (software and hardware). Also, our framework provides a protocol-aware fuzzer for OpenFlow, which is a de-facto standard protocol of SDN, in order to find new vulnerabilities in SDNs.
