# Mobile Malware Mimicking Framework

### Description
Emulating malware is a great way to gain insight into the behaviour of threat actors, and to fetch the newest malware samples and modules from the source. Emulating Android malware using virtual machines is a resource intensive task that does not scale well. To resolve this, I wrote the open-source Mobile Malware Mimicking framework, or m3 in short. The framework is built to easily and scalable emulate Android malware whilst using very few resources. Currently, the renowned Anubis and Cerberus families are supported within the framework.

m3's architecture focuses on three main points: simplicity, security, and scalability. To simplify the implementation of new families, the framework is written in Java, which allows the usage of decompiled code snippets. Additionally, the framework provides internal APIs to simplify the workflow. Each bot contains a phone object, which contains many commonly used Android features in plain Java, optimised for emulation purposes. This way, decompiled code only needs minor tweaks before it is executable within the framework. The framework is secure, as unknown commands are logged and furthermore ignored. Due to its open-source nature, anyone can audit and improve the project. Due to the plain Java implementation of the bots, the framework requires very little memory, compared to the virtual machines that would otherwise be required. Adding more bots barely increases the memory usage, allowing a single machine to handle dozens of bots at once.

To use m3, one must first create one or more bots and provide all required details, after which the bots can be emulated. Logging of activities is done per bot, in both the standard output, and a log file per bot. This provides analysts with a detailed overview of the activities that occurred over time.
